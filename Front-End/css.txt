BOX MODEL : 
	In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
	The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content

	Explanation of the different parts:
		Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
		Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
		Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
		Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

	The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. 

	When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area. To calculate the full size of an element, you must also add padding, borders and margins.

	The total width of an element should be calculated like this:

		Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin

	The total height of an element should be calculated like this:

		Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin
